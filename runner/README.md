# Runner

This is an Elixir daemon that pulls for job our API and executes tests in `runner-container`.

## Dependencies

Benchmarks are running inside a docker container, so you need to have
[`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and
[`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
